        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kensukeken, a painter artist and programmer as well lifelong learner. Welcome to my personal website where I showcase my work and share my thoughts.</p>
        <p>My love for creativity and technology drives everything I do. Fluent in Turkmen, Arabic, and Turkish, I bring a unique cultural perspective to my work.</p>
        <p>I've been playing Geometry Dash since 2015. I am all about creating awesome experiences through code and design. Feel free to check my <a href="../projects/index.html">Projects</a>. Whether I'm painting a picture or making a game,  sometimes <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/"> LaTeX</a>, I put my heart into it. When I'm not coding or painting, I like to explore new ideas, learn new stuff, or play some games. I have a diverse set of interests, including coding, drawing, and writing. I'm currently building new projects on bunch of languages. Welcome to my creative world!</p>
