                <h1>Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid as a New Programmer</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Learning to code is super exciting, but it can be tough too.
                    When you’re just starting out, it's normal to mess up a lot.
                    It can be frustrating, slow you down, and even make you want
                    to quit. Trust me, I’ve been there! Here, I'll talk about
                    five common mistakes new programmers make and share some
                    tips on how to avoid them. Hopefully, this will make your
                    coding journey a bit easier and more fun.</p>

                <h2>1. Skipping the Basics and Jumping to Advanced Stuff</h2>
                <p>When I first started coding, I wanted to dive straight into
                    building cool web apps. I’d heard so much about React and
                    Django and thought learning them right away would make me a
                    pro. But without understanding the basic stuff, I ended up
                    feeling super confused and overwhelmed.</p>
                <strong>Why It's a Mistake:</strong>
                <p>You can't tackle advanced concepts without knowing the
                    basics, like variables, loops, data types, and functions. If
                    you skip these, you'll just get frustrated when your code
                    doesn't work.</p>
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <p>Spend time learning and practicing the basics. I went back to
                    square one and used a simple language like Python. It made
                    everything easier to understand. I worked on small projects
                    and only moved on to more complex stuff when I was ready. A
                    solid foundation really makes learning advanced things a lot
                    easier!</p>

                <h2>2. Not Breaking Problems into Smaller Parts</h2>
                <p>One of my first projects was building a simple calculator. I
                    was so excited that I jumped right into coding without
                    planning anything. The project soon turned into a mess of
                    errors, and I spent hours trying to fix it.</p>
                <strong>Why It's a Mistake:</strong>
                <p>Trying to solve a big problem all at once leads to confusing
                    code that's hard to debug. It slows down your progress and
                    makes coding feel impossible.</p>
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <p>Learn to break problems into smaller steps. After my
                    calculator project disaster, I started making a list of
                    things to do before coding. For the calculator, I first made
                    functions for each operation, then added input checks, and
                    finally combined everything into a simple user interface.
                    This made coding way easier!</p>

                <h2>3. Writing Messy, Hard-to-Read Code</h2>
                <p>In coding school, I used to rush through projects just to
                    make them work. I named my variables things like
                    <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and didn't add any
                    comments. Weeks later, when I looked back at my code, I had
                    no idea what I’d written!</p>
                <strong>Why It's a Mistake:</strong>
                <p>Messy code is hard to understand, which makes it easier to
                    add bugs and harder to fix them.</p>
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <p>Use clear variable and function names. Break big functions
                    into smaller, reusable ones. And always comment on your code
                    to explain tricky parts. Doing this has made debugging a lot
                    easier and my code less scary!</p>

                <h2>4. Ignoring Errors Instead of Debugging</h2>
                <p>When I first started coding, I hated errors. I would ignore
                    them or randomly change my code, hoping the error would go
                    away. Spoiler: it usually made things worse.</p>
                <strong>Why It's a Mistake:</strong>
                <p>Ignoring errors stops you from learning how to find and fix
                    problems. Soon, you'll be stuck in a cycle of frustration
                    with bugs piling up.</p>
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <p>Don't skip errors! Read the error messages and debug your
                    code line by line. Using print statements or the debugging
                    tools in my code editor has really helped me find issues.
                    Now, debugging feels more like solving a puzzle, and I
                    actually kind of enjoy it.</p>

                <h2>5. Trying to Learn Too Many Languages at Once</h2>
                <p>Early on, I was so excited about all the programming
                    languages out there. I started learning Python, JavaScript,
                    and even tried C++. Before long, I was overwhelmed and
                    didn’t make much progress in any of them.</p>
                <strong>Why It's a Mistake:</strong>
                <p>Switching between languages can be confusing, especially if
                    their syntax is different. It splits your focus, making it
                    harder to get good at any one of them.</p>
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <p>Pick one language that matches your goals. I chose Python
                    because it's beginner-friendly and related to data science,
                    which I’m interested in. By focusing on Python, I built a
                    strong foundation. Once I felt confident, learning other
                    languages, like JavaScript, became much easier.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Making mistakes is just part of learning to code. But knowing
                    about these common pitfalls can save you a lot of time and
                    frustration. Build a solid foundation, break problems into
                    smaller steps, write clean code, debug properly, and focus
                    on one language at a time. Remember, coding is a continuous
                    learning process, and every mistake is a chance to grow.
