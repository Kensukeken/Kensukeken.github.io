            <h1> My Response to the First Episode of <ruby>“Serial” <rt>Ser-ial
                    </rt></ruby></h1>
            <p>Listening to the first episode of "Serial" was an interesting
                experience for me. The podcast's approach to research-based
                reporting captured my interest, and I was immediately drawn into
                the detailed storytelling of Adnan Syed and the question of his
                guilt or innocence. Here are my reflections on the episode:
                <br /></p>

            <p>The sponsors mentioned at the beginning of the podcast are NYT
                Audio, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Amazon. They are promoting
                podcast hosting and distribution services. Given these sponsors,
                we can predict that the podcast aims to be widely accessible and
                appealing to a broad audience. The episode opens with a
                recording of someone announcing, “So, it felt very like
                college-like... Without it being… Obviously the next day wasn’t
                classes, it was Gitmo… ”. The music underlying this audio is
                present tense, and interesting. The result creates a mood of
                curiosity and expectation. The music deals with the listener and
                gives an atmosphere of mystery. <br /></p>

            <p>Sarah Koenig, the narrator, speaks in a very informal style. For
                example, she says,
                "I wanted to create a persona, an issue that was not human." Her
                tone is natural and engaging, which pulls the listener in and
                makes the story more compelling. Sarah Koenig provides different
                voices throughout the podcast. These are the voices of those who
                experienced significant events in Guantánamo's evolution. Koenig
                builds his story by introducing a few points of view, granting a
                more full picture of the events. It also adds originality and
                believability to the storytelling. <br /></p>

            <p> In this episode, Sarah Koenig does not reveal any particular
                bias for or against Adnan Syed. She approaches the topic with an
                open mind and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. Her
                neutrality allows listeners to form their own opinions. Based on
                this episode on my own, it is tough to definitively rule on
                Adnan Syed's guilt or innocence. The episode focuses more on
                introducing the context and setting the stage for further
                exploration. More information and evidence are needed to make a
                conclusive judgment. <br /></p>

            <p>Podcasts like this one are very much like a book or especially an
                audiobook, where there is nothing to see or look at for the
                content. This can make it difficult to connect with the content
                compared to movies, television shows, or documentaries Also, it
                is harder to understand what the people were saying because they
                weren’t reading off a script, and it is casually and difficult
                to follow at times. <br /></p>
