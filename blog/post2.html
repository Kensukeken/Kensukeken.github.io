        <h1> My Response to the First Episode of “Serial” </h1>
        
        <p>Listening to the first episode of "Serial" was an interesting experience for me. The podcast's approach to research-based reporting captured my interest, and I was immediately drawn into the detailed storytelling of Adnan Syed and the question of his guilt or innocence. Here are my reflections on the episode: <br/></p>

        <p>The sponsors mentioned at the beginning of the podcast are NYT Audio, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Amazon. They are promoting podcast hosting and distribution services. Given these sponsors, we can predict that the podcast aims to be widely accessible and appealing to a broad audience. The episode opens with a recording of someone announcing, “So, it felt very like college-like... Without it being… Obviously the next day wasn’t classes, it was Gitmo… ”. The music underlying this audio is present tense, and interesting. The result creates a mood of curiosity and expectation. The music deals with the listener and gives an atmosphere of mystery. <br/></p>

        <p>Sarah Koenig, the narrator, speaks in a very informal style. For example, she says, "I wanted to create a persona, an issue that was not human." Her tone is natural and engaging, which pulls the listener in and makes the story more compelling. Sarah Koenig provides different voices throughout the podcast. These are the voices of those who experienced significant events in Guantánamo's evolution. Koenig builds his story by introducing a few points of view, granting a more full picture of the events. It also adds originality and believability to the storytelling. <br/></p>

        <p> In this episode, Sarah Koenig does not reveal any particular bias for or against Adnan Syed. She approaches the topic with an open mind and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. Her neutrality allows listeners to form their own opinions. Based on this episode on my own, it is tough to definitively rule on Adnan Syed's guilt or innocence. The episode focuses more on introducing the context and setting the stage for further exploration. More information and evidence are needed to make a conclusive judgment. <br/></p>

        <p>Podcasts like this one are very much like a book or especially an audiobook, where there is nothing to see or look at for the content. This can make it difficult to connect with the content compared to movies, television shows, or documentaries Also, it is harder to understand what the people were saying because they weren’t reading off a script, and it is casually and difficult to follow at times. <br/></p>
