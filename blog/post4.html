            <h1>Need Advice: How to Succeed in Advanced Functions Despite
                Challenges</h1>

            <p>If you're taking Advanced Functions at night school, you're
                probably feeling the stress—it’s a tough course to manage,
                especially with a schedule that runs from 6:30 PM to 10 PM.
                Getting home at 11 PM can really mess up your sleep routine, and
                if you’re also juggling other courses like Calculus during
                regular school hours, it can feel overwhelming. I’ve been there,
                and I’m here to share some advice on how to handle it.</p>

            <p>First off, let me say that not all teachers are going to make
                this easy for you. My teacher, for instance, wasn’t the best.
                She wasn’t a native English speaker and taught at a very slow
                pace, which made those late-night classes even more tiring. Each
                unit took about three days to finish, and the tests were
                scheduled at 8:30 PM, lasting until 10 PM. There were no
                quizzes, and the final exam only made up 10% of our grade, with
                the Final Summative Evaluation (FSE) making up 20%. The exam
                itself was tricky because you couldn’t go back to previous
                questions, and if you accidentally closed it, you were stuck
                with a zero. This led to a lot of frustration in my class, with
                six students ending up with zeros due to these strict rules.</p>

            <p>But here’s the advice I have for you: don’t let a tough teacher
                or a difficult schedule bring you down. You can still succeed if
                you focus on what you can control. I made sure to stay
                respectful, even when things were frustrating. Instead of
                dwelling on what the teacher wasn’t doing, I took charge of my
                own learning. I spent a lot of time studying on my own, writing
                out my lessons in LaTeX during my late-night hours. This helped
                me review the material regularly, and it paid off. I ended up
                with a 93 in the class, thanks in large part to scoring 100 on
                the FSE.</p>

            <p>Here’s what worked for me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-Study:</strong> Don’t rely solely on the
                    teacher. Take the time to study on your own and really
                    understand the material.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Weak Areas:</strong> Identify where you’re
                    making mistakes and practice those areas until you get them
                    right.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Calm During Exams:</strong> The exams can be
                    stressful, especially with strict rules, but stay calm and
                    prepared. It makes all the difference.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the end, Advanced Functions turned out to be easier for me
                than I initially thought, especially when compared to MCR. By
                focusing on self-study and practicing where it mattered, I was
                able to overcome the challenges. I did less homework but made
                sure the work I did was targeted and effective. If I can do it,
                so can you. <img src="../assets/images/smiley.png" alt="Emoji"
